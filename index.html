            Subject after subject reported that they were on Tinder to find
            someone to love and to love them back and defined love in the most
            traditional of terms: something that took work, a container in
            which sex was sacred and where intimacy built over time. They
            acknowledged that their encounters on Tinder didn’t offer that,
            yet they went to Tinder to find it. The contradiction was
            confusing: They wanted sex to be meaningful but felt that Tinder
            removed the sacredness. They wanted bonds to be lasting but
            acknowledged they were easily broken.

      Someone hands you a belief system and you’re like, oh, this feels so
      good. That’s— and then you have to pause and be like, wait, is this
      designed just to make me feel good? So the short answer is I’m now
      suspicious of pleasure, which I hate.
